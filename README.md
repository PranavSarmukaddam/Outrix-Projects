# üìä Machine Learning Projects Collection

This repository contains three beginner-to-intermediate **Machine Learning projects** implemented in Python using **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn**.  
Each project demonstrates **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation**.

## üìÇ Projects Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Diabetes Prediction
- **File:** [`Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb`](Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb)
- **Goal:** Predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical parameters like glucose level, BMI, and age.
- **Key Steps:**
  1. Data loading and cleaning.
  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
  3. Classification model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
  4. Model evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ House Price Prediction (Regression)
- **File:** [`House_Regression.ipynb`](House_Regression.ipynb)
- **Goal:** Predict house prices based on features such as area, number of rooms, and location.
- **Key Steps:**
  1. Import and preprocess housing dataset.
  2. Perform EDA to explore relationships between features and price.
  3. Apply regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor).
  4. Evaluate performance using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R¬≤ score.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Student Performance Prediction
- **File:** [`Student_Performance.ipynb`](Student_Performance.ipynb)
- **Goal:** Predict student exam scores based on study time, parental education, and other factors.
- **Key Steps:**
  1. Load and clean student performance dataset.
  2. Visualize patterns and correlations.
  3. Train regression model to predict exam scores.
  4. Evaluate using regression metrics.
